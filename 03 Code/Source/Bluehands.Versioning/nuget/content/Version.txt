1.0.0

# Todo

- Specify up to three version number segments (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) in the first line of this file. It is recommended to use semantic versioning: http://semver.org/

- If you want the same version number for all projects in the solution, move this file to the folder of the solution file (.sln). If a Version.txt already exists there, delete this file.

# About

- The fourth version number segment is automatically set to the Git commit count, e.g. if the version number in this file is 1.0.0 and you have made 2 commits, the generated version number will be 1.0.0.2.

- The generated version number will be used to set the AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion attributes.

- The AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute will be set to a string that includes the Git branch name, commit hash and build date.

- The generated attributes are set in Properties\AssemblyVersionInfo.cs, which is added to .gitignore by default.
