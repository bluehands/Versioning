- Specify up to three version number segments (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) in Version.txt. It is recommended to use semantic versioning: http://semver.org/

- If you want the same version number for all projects in a solution, move Version.txt to the folder of the solution file (.sln).

- Make sure to not commit Properties/AssemblyVersionInfo.cs. It is added to .gitignore by default.
